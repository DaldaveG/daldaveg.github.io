        <h1>Job Description</h1>
        <p>As a web developer in the enterprise content services team, my main responsibilities were to create web pages for internal company clients. 
            Assisting with support tickets from clients. This was a good way to reacquaint me with the web management I used last year, and I was up to 
            speed within the first weeks. The tickets ranged anywhere from being requests to update, change, or delete content, to more challenging ones, 
            like finding what is causing a display defect on a page. In both these cases, I used HTML/CSS and got back to the clients. When I had some free time 
            (usually in between different projects) I was given some miscellaneous tasks. I used JavaScript to create a function that would redirect users from a 
            page after a certain amount of time elapsed for security purposes on a site. I was then responsible for handling the updating of a Spring web form for a 
            client. I added and new logic needed for the interaction. I also implemented and added the new content to be sent with the email verification. I then 
            demoed the new form for the client during a meeting where I walked through the process of completing the form while highlighting the key changes. I 
            was also involved in testing and QA work for a software platform upgrade, where I utilized that all components of the platform worked as expected. 
            Before my work term ended, I helped with the migration of an old site to the current WCM being used. </p>
        
        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>To learn about working with data.</li>
            <li>Learn about backend Spring development.</li>
            <li>Improve networking and communication skills.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>1. In my work term, I learned how to use Google Analyitcs to support my team with gatherting data from users in websites. I learned how to 
            create tags and events to track certain website activities that can be showed in reports.</p>

        <p>2. 	I updated a spring web form as per a client's request during my workterm. I learned about the backend functionailty of a 
            form built using spring boot as well as the various security measures that must be considered when handeling data.</p>
            
        <p>3. During my term, I have participated in the believe impact program. This opportunity has allowed me to meet other people 
            and work with them as a team to pitch a solution to an environment issue. I have also gained communication experience by presenting in front of judges.
        </p>


        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>It was great being back at RBC with my old team. I was very impressed at how the company continues to make their student's experience the best one
            possible by hosting various webinars and challenges that offer the students a way to get together. This opportunity has given me the chance to 
            improve my current skills and learn new ones which will help me in the future and let me explore a potential area I can go into further along my career.</p>
