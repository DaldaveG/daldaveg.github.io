        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am Daniela Aldave-Garza, a Computer Science student completing a minor in mathematics at the University of Guelph. This page will highlight my very first co-op experience from May 2020 - December 2020 at RBC after finishing my second year of university.</p>     

        <h1>About The Employer</h1>
        <p>RBC is one of Canada’s largest banks by market capitalization, and one of North America’s leading financial services companies, providing personal and commercial banking, wealth management, insurance, investor services, and capital markets products. bank in Canada by market capitalization. They have offices  serving over 17 million clients in Canada, U.S, and 34 other countries!</p>

        <h1>Job Description</h1>
        <p>As a web developer in the enterprise content services team, my main responsibilities were to create web pages for internal company clients. The first thing I needed to do was to learn how to use the WCM (OpenText TeamSite) used to maintain RBC’s internal website branches, which is what much of my work revolved around. My first task was to help my team replace all old links hosted on EWCMS (a legacy system which was scheduled to be taken down) with their new replacement ones in the WCM on any page that had them across all company branch sites. The projects I have worked on with my team after were from internal clients who wanted to migrate their site from older servers to the WCM used now. I built out pages using our WCM according to the content matrix and page mocks provided by the clients. Tools and technologies that I used were HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and bootstrap and XSLT (both of which I learned on the job) to create custom components for the sites as well as the layout and design for pages specified by mocks. I was later responsible for holding training sessions with the clients to teach them how to operate within the WCM to enable them to make updates to their own sites in the future. In addition to web development, I was involved in QA testing of the pages I worked on by rebuilding them out in lower environments to help test application functionality, as well as upgrade testing for the environments, in which I used JIRA to track the progress for each test.</p>
