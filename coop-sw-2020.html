        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am Daniela Aldave-Garza, a Computer Science student completing a minor in mathematics at the University of Guelph. This page will highlight my very first co-op experience from May 2020 - December 2020 after finishing my Second year at Guelph.</p>     

        <h1>About The Employer</h1>
        <p>RBC is one of Canada’s largest banks by market capitalization, and one of North America’s leading financial services companies, providing personal and commercial banking, wealth management, insurance, investor services, and capital markets products. bank in Canada by market capitalization. They have offices  serving over 17 million clients in Canada, U.S, and 34 other countries!</p>

        <h1>Job Description</h1>
        <p>As a web developer in the enterprise content services team, my main responsibilities were to create web pages for internal company clients. The first thing I needed to do was to learn how to use the WCM (OpenText TeamSite) used to maintain RBC’s internal website branches, which is what much of my work revolved around. My first task was to help my team replace all old links hosted on EWCMS (a legacy system which was scheduled to be taken down) with their new replacement ones in the WCM on any page that had them across all company branch sites. The projects I have worked on with my team after were from internal clients who wanted to migrate their site from older servers to the WCM used now. I built out pages using our WCM according to the content matrix and page mocks provided by the clients. Tools and technologies that I used were HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and bootstrap and XSLT (both of which I learned on the job) to create custom components for the sites as well as the layout and design for pages specified by mocks. I was later responsible for holding training sessions with the clients to teach them how to operate within the WCM to enable them to make updates to their own sites in the future. In addition to web development, I was involved in QA testing of the pages I worked on by rebuilding them out in lower environments to help test application functionality, as well as upgrade testing for the environments, in which I used JIRA to track the progress for each test.</p>
    
        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <h4>Fall 2020 Work Term</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn to work in a professional and team environment</li>
            <li>Improve netorking skills</li>
            <li>Learn more Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Throughout this term, I have been part of a team which helped me learn that I can rely on others for help and support when needed 
            and vice versa. This experience

            My Second goal was to improve my networking skills. I used a platform called 10 Thousand Coffees which matches you with another employee from the company every few weeks. I reached out and held chats with others and learned about what jobs they do, responsibilities they have and what opportunities there are.
            
            My last goal for this term was to learn more Python. I used learning platforms available from RBC to complete tutorials. While not working with Python as much in 
            the Fall term, I put my new skills to use in the Winter term by using Python to create a Slack bot with my team for a company held innovation challenge. This was a great learning experience 
            as I got to apply my newfound skills to work with APIs which was also new to me.
        </p>


        <h4>Winter 2020 Work Term</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn more about data science by connecting with other employees</li>
            <li>Learn the fundamentals of Spring Boot</li>
            <li>Improve my communication skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My first goal for this term was to learn more about the area of data science/analysis. I also used 10K Coffees to connect with a data analyst from RBC. 
            
            My last goal was to improve my communication skills. Throughout my workterm, I have been a part of daily standup meetings for the projects I worked on. These have helped me 
            explain my ideas. Additionally, I was responsible for training clients to use the WCM this term. This has helped me learn how to articulate and present myself in a clear and concise manner to others.
        </p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>RBC was a fantastic company to work for in my first co-op work terms. This opportunity has given me the chance to improve my current skills and learn new ones which will help me
            in the future and let me explore a potential area I can go into further along my career. 

             Despite the circumstances of the pandemic, I never felt unmotivated or disconnected from my team.
