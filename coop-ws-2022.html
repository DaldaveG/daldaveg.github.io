        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am Daniela Aldave-Garza, a Computer Science student completing a minor in mathematics at the University of Guelph. This page will highlight my second co-op experience in Summer 2021 back at RBC.</p>     

        <h1>About The Employer</h1>

        <h1>Job Description</h1>
        <p>In my Winter 2022 term, I started working on a large project with my team in a revamp of the main company site. My responsibility was to create the backend for the comments, favourites, and likes API for an entirely new comments engine and favourites/liking functionality. I used Java and Spring Boot to develop the needed actions, including posting, deleting and reporting a comment, and favouriting a page or liking a comment/article. I demoed some of the functionality in code reviews with my team and in meetings with the clients. Having delved deep into backend development in my winter term, the bulk of my work in the summer term was frontend development. My responsibilities were to develop the frontend styles, design, and functionality of various components of the site according to the design mocks. I developed the components using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript. Consisting of lost of design reviews with UX design to make sure all components adhered to design, accessibility, and company standards.  I learned the importance of always keeping the security of an application in mind. Additional tasks I was assigned this term was to help some clients create pages for their products on their site, finishing for another site project, and assisting my team by completing support tickets. As their needs evolved beyond adding extra pages, I hosted sessions to propose possible solutions to their site design. The support tickets I helped with ranged from updating documents in the WCM for clients to content changes on pages.</p>

        <p>1.   There was a suspected error with one of the components I was working on. I took the opportunity with a team member to investigate if anything was wrong, which I used to look into the backend code and gained an understanding of how they work. </p>

        <p>2. 	This term I was unfortunately unable to participate in the challenge hosted by the student program. I did however, attend student run information sessions where I learned about tools and technologies used by others in their work.</p>
            
        <p>3. 	This term, I attended all of my student community meetings where we would learn about each other's work, interests and other opportunities out there.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>It was great being back at RBC with my old team. I was very impressed at how the company continues to make their student's experience the best one
